*Unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip into folder D:\R.

*"run_analysis.R" is the code to clean up the data and saved in D:\R. 

*Use source("run_analysis.R") in R.

*Get two output files in working directory: "merged_cleanData.txt" and "mean_Data.txt".

*"mean_Data.txt" is the file asked in step 5.
